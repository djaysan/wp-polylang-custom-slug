== Description ==

1. Synchronize Post Slugs Across Languages
* Automatically use the same slug for posts across all languages, ensuring consistency in URL structures.
* Example: A post with the English slug about-us will have the same slug across all language variations (/fr/about-us/, /es/about-us/).
* Ensure compatibility with both standard posts and custom post types.

2. Synchronize Term Slugs Across Languages
* Ensure taxonomy term slugs (categories, tags, or custom taxonomies) are shared across all languages for consistency.
* Offer an option to inherit the slug from the default language or manually define a consistent slug for each term.
Example: A category with the slug technology will remain the same across all languages (/fr/technology/, /es/technology/).

3. Shared Media Across All Languages
Enable media library items (images, videos, PDFs) to be shared across all languages without duplication.
* Automatically link a single media item to all translations of a post or term, reducing storage redundancy.
* Example: An image uploaded for an English post will be available for use in the French or Spanish versions of the same post without needing re-upload or duplication.
